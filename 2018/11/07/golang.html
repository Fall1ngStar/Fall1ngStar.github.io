<h1 id="golang">Golang</h1>
<p><strong>Golang</strong> is a programming language created by <strong>Google</strong> used in a lot of projects, like <strong>Docker, Kubernetes, Uber, â€¦</strong></p>

<p>This language seems to be a really complete programming language and permit to do a lot of things, to make syntax clear and concise, and make complex calculations.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>Golang</strong> is usable for programming the <strong>Twitter Bot</strong> we want to do thanks to a lot of libraries.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var i int = 0
j := 0 Here there are two way to initialize variables, they are equivalents but the second is shorter.


func test(x, y string) (string, string) {
	return y, x
} This is the way to initialize functions in **Golang**. The first key word is *func* followed by the name of the function, here *test*. The first brackets are the passing arguments and their type, and the seconds are the type of the return arguments. With **Golang**, you can return more than one arguments.
