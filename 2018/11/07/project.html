<p>We are going to program a <strong>Twitter bot</strong> named <strong>Planning Twitter Bot</strong> that is sending :</p>
<ul>
  <li>The next lesson <strong>every hour</strong>, 15 minutes before</li>
  <li>A daily planning <strong>every evening</strong></li>
  <li>A weekly planning <strong>every sunday</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We will use the <a href="https://english-project.tgarcin.fr/golang/discovery/2018/11/07/golang.html">Golang</a> to program it, and it will be host on AWS.</p>

<p>If this project is too easy to realize, a good next step is to add a graphical planning generation (an image) that is send every week.</p>
